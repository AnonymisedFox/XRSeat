# XRSeat prototype 

This repository contains **all the parts, files, and components required for the fabrication and assembly of the XRSeat prototype**.
Every element has been included to ensure a complete understanding of the structure, the interactions between parts, and the overall system behavior.


## Introduction: what is XRSeat?
XRSeat is a system we built to facilitate the creation of multimodal experiences in Extended Reality (XR). 
It is a chair device providing lighting, spatialized audio, vibro-tactile feedback and wind sensations. We submitted a scientific paper to the IMX 2026 conference with more details about this research prototype.

To start, we suggest to have a look at the Technical_Drawings_Prototype pdf to have a global view of the chair and its components.
You then then have a look at the list of Required_Hardware, before digging into the design files in the CAD and Step_Files folder. 
Happy exploration!


## Content of this repo
The current repo, anonymised for the submission of the paper, contains:
* Mechanical and structural parts
* Assembly elements
* Design and reference files
* Prototype-specific components



## File Formats

All design files are **also provided in native SolidWorks format**, ensuring full parametric access, editability, and compatibility with SolidWorks-based workflows.



## Known issues
Currently, the POÄNG chair chair model is **not** provided in STEP format.
This results in:
* limited parametric editing,
* constraints when integrating the model into certain CAD software,
* the need for adaptation or conversion if structural modifications are required.


## Note

Aside from this specific issue, **all other prototype elements are present and usable** in their current format.
